# Software Engineering Final Project

## DELIVERABLES

Program code:

For new components of the system there should be source code. For OTS 
(Off – The - Shelf) components that were already available this is not 
always possible. A reference to the source code and an executable are 
needed for these components. All code must be clearly annotated to 
clarify its functionality and to express the relations between pieces of 
code, and between the code and other system artefacts.

Configuration parameters:

Larger components and in particular OTS components may have 
configuration parameters. The values of these parameters are essential 
elements of the system. The relationship between the required 
functionality, the provided functionality and the values of the 
configuration parameters must be well documented.

Verification:

Test specification: What will be tested?

Test script: How will it be done?

Test cases: The test scenario’s with input data and expected results.

Test criteria: What are the criteria to determine that the test is 
successful?

Test report: A summary containing the outcomes of the different tests 
and the overall conclusion
